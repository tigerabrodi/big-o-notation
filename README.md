# Big O Notation

The time it takes to run your function, as the size of your input grows. How does the runtime of this function grow?

Check the Big O Notation for each expression, and eventually add them up.

- **Linear Time O(n):** Increases almost lineary with the size of the input, i.e. a for loop.

- **Constant Time O(1):** Operation always takes the same time, i.e. array look up.

- **Quadratic Time O(nÂ²)**: Increases as the square of the number of points, i.e. a nested for loop.

- **Polynomial Time O(n^c):** Polynomial running is represented as, when `c > 1`.

- **Logarithmic Time O(log n):** Logarithmic time complexities usually apply to algorithms that divide problems in half every time.

- **Exponential Time O(2^n):** Exponential (base 2) running time means that the calculations performed by an algorithm double every time as the input grows.
